# TODO

1. Replace all examples with full port output (-dd)
1. Create Readme
    1. Describe algorithm: Port is considered open when "open" or "open|filtered". -- That may be changed via cli parameter, same goes for close.
1. How do we handle "filtered"?
    1. Is this equivalent to "closed"?
    1. Shall we make this part of the configuration?
